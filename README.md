# CHE-277-final

This Project compares the results of various machine learning models on the polymerization data found below. In order to properly run this code, there are 5 CSVs that must be uploaded to the python script in lines 19-23. These files are in the attached github repository. The file path in this script is specific to the user and must be updated for each user for their own unique file path in order to ensure proper reading of the CSV.
- Full_VA_DATA
- ba_raw_data
- mmd_raw_data
- mn-mw_raw_data
- rt_raw_data

The python libraries that are used and must be installed are listed below:
- matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
- pandas (pip install pandas)
- numpy (pip install numpy)
- scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn)
- seaborn (pip install seaborn)
- pytorch (pip install torch)

After the libraries are installed, the script imports all required libraries and functionalities required to use the script.

The code is annotated as clearly as possible in order ensure the user can follow what the code is doing. In some cases, the code refers the user back to the acoompyaning report in order to ensure that the proper amount of detail is given.
